-> Created DataSets Has been named as "datasetA.csv" and "datasetB.csv".
-> While doing Decision Tree part(part3), quotations have been removed from the header row in "datasetB.csv".
-> Jupyter Notebook is used and "NOTEBOOK.html" is attached for better and easy understanding of all parts.
-> In all the codes, proper path to datsets should be used while reading from csv file like
   "C:\\ML\\17CS10054_ML_A2\\data\\datasetB.csv"
-> Various Evaluation metrics of models are as follows:
