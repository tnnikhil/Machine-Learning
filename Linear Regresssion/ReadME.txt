1)Folder contains 3 sub-folders corresponding to each part
2)In each of the source code, the location of the train and test data has to be changed accordingly.
3)I did entire assignment in Jupyter Notebook and attached it in the folder. Since I wrote in JUPYTER Notebook, I copied the code from one cell 
  to the next cell and source code contains the same.
4)For a better understanding, 
	"PLEASE REFER ATTACHED NOTEBOOK" 
  It gives more clear idea than all source code files.
